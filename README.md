## <font color='blue'> Overview of the initial labs </font>

The labs for the first three weeks in the IoT module will including the following, aimed at introducing you to the Architecture of a complete IoT solution at a basic level

### Lab 1

The first lab will guide you through the installation of an MQTT broker, interacting with the broker from CLI, configuring the listeners and a simulator program that acts as the IoT devices publishing data to the broker periodically

### Lab 2

This lab will discuss and help you through the concepts of Authentication and Authorization of the IoT devices, Setting up a Database to store the data from IoT devices (Telemetry) and a simulator program that acts as a backend interfacing the broker and the database.
